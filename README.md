# FootBall-Quiz
A basic quiz about football, including 20 Levels through 3 difficulties: Easy, Medium, Hard. 
There are more features i'm going to add such as: 
	●Timer: to make the game more enjoyable and fun to play. 
	●Guess the player: basically instead of questions, some levels will have photos of a random footballer depending on the difficulty, and the player will have to guess his name.
 	●Score: the player will have to claim a certain amount of score to advance to each level. 
	●Bonus Levels: Additional levels.
